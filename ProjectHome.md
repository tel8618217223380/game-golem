Game-Golem is a [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748) auto-player for Facebook games.

The aim of the code is to be almost entirely modular. Some modules may rely on others (such as most modules needing the basic Player stats module).

This uses jQuery extensively, with jQueryUI being used where needed.

Initially it will only work on Castle Age - in fact, it is currently only written for that. Castle Age uses a codebase very similar to various Zynga games (though there is no indication they are related), so should be easy to add others later.

Each module is kept in a separate file, where they will only come together for actual releases.
