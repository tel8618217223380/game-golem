# Introduction #

So you think you've found a bug and needed to know what to do, so you clicked on the little bug icon. Well, it's simple enough.

The first step is to make sure you're running the most up-to-date version of Golem. Only the "Beta" versions are current, so if you're not using a beta version then there is a high chance it has already been fixed.

The second step is to scan the recent topics on the [Golem Discussion Board](http://userscripts.org/scripts/discuss/67412), and the open [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/game-golem/issues/list). If your bug is already known then there may be help already on it's way.

# Where To Go #

You have two options for bug reporting.

  1. Report it on the official [Discussion Board](http://userscripts.org/scripts/discuss/67412) on userscripts.org, or
  1. Fill out an [Issue](http://code.google.com/p/game-golem/issues/list) on here.

Please make sure that you can reproduce the bug before filing an Issue, but if you're going on the discussion board then one-off events are ok.

# Bug Reports #

Please make sure that you clearly state as much information as you can.

The Issue tracker gives a template for you to fill in. This contains the most important information for developers to help find and fix your bug.

# Temporary Solution #

Most bugs are related to a single "Worker" - these Workers are responsible for specific areas within Golem.

You are able to Disable any worker by clicking on the small menu icon (![http://game-golem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/menu.png](http://game-golem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/menu.png)) and clicking on the "![http://game-golem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/tick.png](http://game-golem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/tick.png) Enabled" item. Workers that are "![http://game-golem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/cross.png](http://game-golem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/cross.png) Disabled" have a different colour background and will be prevented from running.
